# AI Agent Design Patterns

AI agents are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Let's explore the key patterns that make them effective.

## Core Patterns

### 1. ReAct Pattern

[ReAct Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

The **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting) pattern combines:
- **Reasoning**: The agent thinks about what to do
- **Acting**: The agent takes action based on reasoning
- **Observing**: The agent observes the results

```typescript
// define the ReActAgent interface
interface ReActAgent {
  reason(observation: string): string;
  act(reasoning: string): Action;
  observe(action: Action): string;
}
```

### 2. Chain of Thought

> "Breaking down complex problems into simpler steps leads to better reasoning."

This pattern involves:
1. Decompose the problem
2. Solve each sub-problem
3. Combine the solutions

## Key Takeaways

- Agents need clear **mental models**
- Tools should be `composable` and `reusable`
- State management is critical
