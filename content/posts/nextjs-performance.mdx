# Next.js Performance Optimization

Performance is **crucial** for modern web applications. Let's dive into techniques that can dramatically improve your Next.js app.

## Image Optimization

Next.js provides the `<Image>` component with automatic optimization:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero"
      width={1200}
      height={600}
      priority
    />
  )
}
```

### Benefits:
- Automatic format optimization (WebP, AVIF)
- Lazy loading by default
- Responsive images
- Blur placeholder support

## Code Splitting Strategies

| Strategy | Use Case | Performance Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Dynamic Imports | Large components | High |
| Route-based | Default Next.js | Medium |
| Component-level | Heavy libraries | High |

### Example Dynamic Import:

```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <Skeleton />,
  ssr: false
})
```

## Caching Strategies

> Cache what's expensive, invalidate what's changed.

1. **Static Generation** - Pre-render at build time
2. **ISR** - Regenerate static pages periodically
3. **Client-side Cache** - React Query, SWR

*Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.*
